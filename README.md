### Incremental Learning for Classifying Document Types Based on Content and/or layout.

## Descripton: 
Developing an incremental learning system to classify various document types from scanned images of documents. The model should adapt to new document types as they emerge.

### Data:
RVL-CDIP : aharley/rvl_cdip · Datasets at Hugging Face
PubLayNet - IBM Developer
DocBank: liminghao1630/DocBank · Datasets at Hugging Face
